# introduction: your ai journey starts here

## welcome to your ai journey

Whether you found this guide through my newsletter [ninagpt: field notes from my ai journey](https://ninaverse.kit.com/36228eea47) or stumbled upon it here on GitHub, I'm glad you're here. I hope it helps you make sense of AI.

I'm Nina, a non-tech person but a lifelong self-learner. When [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) launched, I got amazed, curious, excited. I started using it for everything: wine recommendations, asking about weird pimples, figuring out why guys send confusing texts, research for work, brainstorming creative projects. I even sent it post-workout selfies asking about my muscle gains.

I was that person who would try AI for literally anything.

Over time, I discovered other tools. [Claude](https://claude.ai) turned out to be great for writing. [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai) was perfect for research. I started using [Canva AI](https://canva.com) for graphics and [Gamma](https://gamma.app) for presentations.

I am still amazed by this technology. Suddenly the stories I read about tech entrepreneurs feel much less distant.

My curiosity grew. I wanted to understand what was really going on. Not just which buttons to click, but how this stuff actually works.

## why this guide exists

I created this because I needed to understand the fundamentals before diving deeper into Python or coding with AI. I wanted to actually get how this stuff works, not just know which prompts to type into ChatGPT.

**What you'll get:** By the end, you'll understand what's happening when you chat with AI, know how to choose the right tools, and feel confident using AI in ways that actually help your life and work.

## how to use this guide

Each level builds on the previous one. Plan for 10-11 hours total, but take breaks. "Smooth is fast, fast is slow" - rushing through actually slows down real understanding.

**What you'll see:**

→ **visual learning:** Simple diagrams that show how things work  
→ **heart check-ins:** Quick emotional processing moments  
→ **clarifiers:** Instant explanations when new terms show up  
→ **try it now:** Real actions you can take immediately  
→ **nina's examples:** Stories from my AI learning journey

**How to get the most out of it:**

→ Read each level completely before trying activities  
→ Explain concepts in your own words after reading  
→ Actually try the "try it now" suggestions  
→ Come back to sections that didn't click the first time

## the 4 types of ai learners

Before we dive in, let's acknowledge how you might be feeling right now. I've been all of these at different times.

### the explorer: "this sounds exciting - show me everything!"

You'll move quickly through the material. Don't skip the foundation stuff even if it seems obvious - it helps you explain things to others later, and you'll catch details that make advanced techniques work better.

### the practical user: "i just want to know if this helps me get things done"

Perfect! Every concept connects to immediate practical value. You'll especially love the workflow sections where we get into real daily applications.

### the thoughtful skeptic: "i'm not sure this is safe or worth the hype"

We'll address your concerns directly. Understanding how AI works usually makes you feel better about it while helping you decide when and how to use it.

### the hesitant learner: "this feels overwhelming and maybe not for people like me"

Take a moment to notice what's going on for you right now. Are you feeling excited? Nervous? Skeptical? Overwhelmed? 

There's no pressure to love AI or use every tool. This guide helps you understand it so you can decide what fits your life. Whatever you're feeling right now is totally fine.

When I started, I was mostly Explorer with some Practical User mixed in. Now I'm more Thoughtful Skeptic meets Explorer - excited about possibilities but wanting to understand what's actually happening.



## ready to begin?

You're about to start something that will change how you approach work, learning, and problem-solving.

The best time to learn AI was five years ago. The second-best time is right now.

### clarifier: ai literacy

**AI literacy** = Understanding how to work with artificial intelligence

Just like we learned to use computers and the internet, we're now learning to work with AI. This means understanding how AI works (the concepts, not programming), knowing when it helps and when it doesn't, and being able to communicate well with AI systems.
