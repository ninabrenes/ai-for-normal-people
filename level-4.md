```

Not all AI is the same. Just like people have different specialties, AI systems are designed for different types of tasks.

## the three main ai specializations

AI systems are trained to be experts in specific types of information:

### 1. large language models (llms) - text specialists

**What they're trained on:** Billions of books, articles, websites, conversations

**What they do well:**
→ Having conversations  
→ Writing and editing text  
→ Explaining complex topics  
→ Creative writing

**Examples:** [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Claude](https://claude.ai), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)

### 2. computer vision ai - image specialists

**What they're trained on:** Millions of labeled images and visual content

**What they do well:**
→ Recognizing objects in photos  
→ Creating original artwork  
→ Understanding visual scenes  
→ Generating images from text descriptions

**Examples:** [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2), [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com), [Canva AI](https://canva.com)

### 3. audio ai - sound specialists

**What they're trained on:** Speech patterns, music, and audio processing

**What they do well:**
→ Understanding spoken language  
→ Generating music  
→ Voice synthesis

**Examples:** Siri/Alexa, Spotify recommendations, voice transcription

## multimodal ai: combining specializations

Newer AI systems work with multiple types of information:

**Examples:**
→ **GPT-4V** - can see images AND have conversations about them  
→ **[Claude](https://claude.ai) with vision** - can analyze documents and images while chatting

## why you need different ai tools

Each AI type learned from different examples, so they're good at different things:

**[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)** learned from text examples:
→ Brilliant at writing and conversations  
→ Can't create images (unless it's GPT-4V)

**[DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2)** learned from image examples:
→ Great at creating artwork  
→ Can't have conversations

This is like having a team of specialists: writing specialist, visual specialist, audio specialist, research specialist.

### clarifier: matching ai to tasks

| Your Task | Best AI Type | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Writing, conversations | Large Language Models | [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Claude](https://claude.ai) |
| Creating images | Computer Vision | [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2), [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com) |
| Research with sources | LLM + Web access | [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai) |
| Voice interactions | Audio AI | Siri, Alexa |

## my tool selection strategy

I use different AI tools because each has its specialty:

→ **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com):** Quick questions, brainstorming  
→ **[Claude](https://claude.ai):** Serious writing work, creating content like this guide  
→ **[Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai):** Research when I need current information with sources  
→ **[Canva AI](https://canva.com):** Creating graphics for presentations  

I don't expect one tool to do everything well.

## connecting the dots

**What we learned:** AI systems are specialists trained on different types of data (text, images, audio), which is why you need different tools for different jobs

**What this builds on:** Each AI type uses the same pattern recognition approach from Level 1, but they learned from different examples, making them good at different things

**What's next:** You'll discover that you've already been using AI successfully for years, which should boost your confidence about learning conversational AI

## your turn

**Consider:** Which AI specialization seems most useful for the type of work you do?

**Try this:** Next time you have a task involving both writing and images, think about which AI tools you'd need.

**Back:** Large Language Models (text specialists), Computer Vision AI (image specialists), Audio AI (sound specialists)

**Front:** Why can't [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) create images?  
**Back:** [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) is a Large Language Model trained specifically on text patterns - it learned how to work with words, not visual patterns

→ **Next:** [level 5: ai you're already using successfully](level-5.md) they're good at different things:

**[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)** learned from text examples, so it's brilliant at:
→ Writing emails and documents  
→ Having conversations  
→ Explaining concepts  
→ But it can't create images or understand photos (unless it's GPT-4V)

**[DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2)** learned from image examples, so it's great at:
→ Creating artwork from descriptions  
→ Understanding visual concepts  
→ Generating logos and designs  
→ But it can't have conversations or write text

This is like having a team of specialists:
→ Writing specialist (LLMs)  
→ Visual specialist (Image AI)  
→ Audio specialist (Sound AI)  
→ Research specialist (AI with web access)

## how different ais combine technologies

Let's look at some popular AI tools and what they are:

**[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)** = Deep Learning + Large Language Model + Generative Capability
→ Foundation: Deep Learning (complex pattern recognition)  
→ Specialization: Large Language Model (understands text)  
→ Capability: Generative (creates new text)  
→ Result: AI that can have conversations and write original content

**[DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2)** = Deep Learning + Computer Vision + Generative Capability
→ Foundation: Deep Learning  
→ Specialization: Computer Vision (understands images)  
→ Capability: Generative (creates new images)  
→ Result: AI that creates artwork from text descriptions

**[Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai)** = Deep Learning + Large Language Model + Web Search
→ Foundation: Deep Learning  
→ Specialization: Large Language Model  
→ Capability: Web search + citation  
→ Result: AI that can research current information and cite sources

## my tool selection strategy

I use different AI tools because each one has its specialty:

→ **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com):** Quick questions, brainstorming, photo analysis (when I send pics of weird pimples or muscle progress)  
→ **[Claude](https://claude.ai):** Serious writing work, creating content like this guide, longer analysis  
→ **[Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai):** Research when I need current information with real sources  
→ **[Canva AI](https://canva.com):** Creating graphics and visual content for presentations  
→ **[Gamma](https://gamma.app):** Building presentations quickly

I don't expect one tool to do everything well. It's like having different experts on your team.

### clarifier: model names decoded

**Model** = a specific version of an AI system with particular capabilities

**Examples:**
→ GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5 = newer vs older version (like iPhone 15 vs iPhone 12)  
→ Claude-3-Opus vs Claude-3-Haiku = powerful vs fast version  
→ Different models = different capabilities and costs

**Why versions matter:**
→ Newer models usually more capable but cost more  
→ Some models optimized for speed, others for quality  
→ Knowing the model helps you choose the right tool

## common misconceptions

**"AI should be able to do everything"**  
Current AI is specialized. Each type learned from specific examples and is good at specific tasks.

**"[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) is the only AI I need"**  
[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) is amazing at text but can't create images, search the web (without plugins), or analyze your documents.

**"All AI tools are basically the same"**  
Each AI has different training, capabilities, and strengths. Choosing the right one makes a big difference.

## heart check-in

Does understanding AI specializations help explain why some AI tools seem "smarter" at certain tasks? It's like realizing that being good at writing doesn't automatically make someone good at painting - different skills require different training.

Remember: AI specialization is a good thing - it means you get expert-level help for specific tasks rather than mediocre help for everything.

## your turn

**Quick reflection:** Which AI specialization seems most useful for the type of work or creativity you do?

**Try this:** Next time you have a task that involves both writing and images, think about which AI tools you'd need and why.

**Think about your current use:** If you've been using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) for everything, what other AI types might help you with tasks it struggles with?
