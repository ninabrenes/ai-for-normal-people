by nina brenes

## about this guide
ai is changing how we work, learn, and solve problems. this guide takes you from ai anxiety to ai competence without the technical jargon or overwhelming complexity.

this is version 1.0 - i'll update it as ai evolves and as i learn new things.

## who this is for
→ non-technical people who want practical ai skills for work and life  
→ anyone feeling overwhelmed by ai hype and tools  
→ professionals, parents, students, and lifelong learners  
→ people who want to use ai while staying human-centered

## who am i?
aside from being a goofy weirdo, i'm a self-learner, systems thinker, and a normal person just trying to make sense of ai.
