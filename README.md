# ai for normal people
*a human-centered guide to understanding and using ai*

by nina brenes

## about this guide

whether you found this through my newsletter [ninagpt: field notes from my ai journey](https://ninaverse.kit.com/36228eea47) or stumbled upon it here on github, this guide will take you from ai anxiety to ai competence.

this is version 1.0 - i'll be updating it as ai evolves and as i learn new things.

## who am i?

aside from being a goofy weirdo, i'm a self-learner, systems thinker, and currently working as an ai operations consultant. i'm also exploring writing as therapy. this guide represents everything i wish i'd known when i started learning ai as a non-technical person.

## how to use this guide

→ read sequentially - each level builds on previous ones  
→ use the flashcards provided in each level (download [anki](https://ankiweb.net/) for mobile/desktop or go analog)  
→ try the "your turn" exercises  
→ take your time - understanding matters more than speed
