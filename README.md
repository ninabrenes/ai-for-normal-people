# ai for normal people
*a human-centered guide to understanding and using ai*

by nina brenes

## about this guide
ai is changing how we work, learn, and solve problems. this guide takes you from ai anxiety to ai competence without the technical jargon or overwhelming complexity.

whether you found this through my newsletter [ninagpt: field notes from my ai journey](https://ninaverse.kit.com/36228eea47) or stumbled upon it here on github, you'll learn to use ai confidently and effectively.

this is version 1.0 - i'll update it as ai evolves and as i learn new things.

## who this is for
→ non-technical people who want practical ai skills for work and life  
→ anyone feeling overwhelmed by ai hype and tools  
→ professionals, parents, students, and lifelong learners  
→ people who want to use ai while staying human-centered

## who am i?
aside from being a goofy weirdo, i'm a self-learner, systems thinker, and currently working as an ai operations consultant. i'm also exploring writing as therapy. this guide represents everything i wish i'd known when i started learning ai as a non-technical person.

## how to use this guide

**practice actively** - use the exercises in each level  
**take your time** - understanding matters more than speed
