## about

this guide represents everything i wish i'd known when starting my ai journey as a non-technical person. every concept comes from real experience learning to work with ai while staying human-centered.

this is version 1.0 - i'll update it over time as ai evolves and as i learn more.

## share it

feel free to share this guide with anyone who might benefit. the world needs more people who understand both what ai can do and what humans do best.
